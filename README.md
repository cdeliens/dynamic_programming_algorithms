Lab 1 y 2 Knight Tour
* Animation could take a lot of time, I ran it more than 20 mins.
* Board is always square.
* Initial position x,y of the board, should be separated by a comma.

```ruby
ruby knight_tour.rb "board_size" "initial_position" "animation"
ruby knight_tour.rb 5 1,1 true
```

Lab 3 Jenga
```ruby
* "k" "p" = random number of pieces to take.
ruby jenga.rb "number_of_pieces" "k" "p"
ruby jenga.rb 8 3 6
```
